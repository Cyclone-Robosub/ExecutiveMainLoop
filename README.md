# DriverEnvironment
Please Read https://www.notion.so/crsucd/GitHub-Organization-1d88a3eca2f0808f9eacc3a7fbea26df?pvs=4 if developing for us
to understand the branch mangement.
## Set up
---
Run only once to set up ROS on your environment:
```
cd misc
chmod +x ros2jazzyinstall.sh
./ros2jazzyinstall.sh
```
Ninja is optional but is faster then makefiles

Once you have clone the repo:

Check for ros2 symlink inside of ros2_ws/src (Check if files are there)

Check for Executive_Propulsion/Pi/CmakeLists.txt compile problem fixed.

## Build/Compile
---
Run from /ExecutiveMainLoop/scripts
```
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
or if you are plugged to a nuclear reactor and have 16 cores of gaming 
Make sure you Control-C once finished compling to exit out of the bash script 
for this option.
```
chmod +x buildQuick.sh
./buildQuick.sh
```
## Run the ExecutiveMainLoop Functions
again run from /ExecutiveMainLoop/scripts
```
chmod +x startup.sh
./startup.sh
```
### Manual Control/Python CLTool
from /ExecutiveMainLoop/scripts
```
chmod +x startupCL.sh
./startupCL.sh
```
follow the directions printed or read the code (lol what documentation?)

Note: In the Robot/Rasberry Pi, the startup.sh should run on startup, and the build files should already be built on the Pi 5.

## Testing
---
building for test:
```
colcon build --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
```
Run the test:
```
colcon test --packages-select executive_main_loop
```
Run with detailed test results:
```
colcon test --packages-select executive_main_loop --event-handlers console_direct+
```
To check test results:
```
colcon test-result --all
```
To see which test cases failed (if any):
```
colcon test-result --all --verbose
```
## Tips
---
If you encounter the following:
```
CMake Error: Error: generator Unix Makefiles
does not match with the generator used previously: Ninja
```
or vice versa, got to the root of the project, then:
```
rm -rf build/*
```
Then, rerun the build command.

```
WARNING:colcon.colcon_cmake.task.cmake.build:Could not run installation step for package 'InertialSenseSDK' because it has no 'install' target
```
The above error does not affect the final executable.

Non-existing Submodule Paths

If you encounter the following or something similar:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
fatal: No url found for submodule path 'lib/Propulsion' in .gitmodules
```
or any other submodule, do:
```
git rm lib/Propulsion
```
or the submodule path in question.
Then do:
```
git submodule sync
```
And finally, try initing the submodules.
